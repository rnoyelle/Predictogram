# Predictogram


Predictogram explores the Gray dataset using a linear regression trying to predict a signal from another from different brain regions and from different frequency band. It also transforms the raw data from MATLAB to NumPy-ready and applies the usual pre-processing steps as well as dealing with the analysis and visualization of the results.


network :

conv layers

FC layers

deconv layers

Its filtered the signal between : 7 and 12 Hz. It select time between : -800ms before sample on to +600ms after sample off -600 before match on to +2000ms after match on

It cuts signal into windows of 200 ms with a step of 100 ms.

the network is fitted on a tranning base (80% of the dataset) and then test on a testing base (20% of the dataset).

The measure of the performance used if the r2 score.
